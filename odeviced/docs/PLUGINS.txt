For writing plugins refer the example ones present in plugins/

There are two types of configurations files which odeviced reads at
startup. 

* The global configuration located at /etc/odeviced.conf
* Plugin specific configuration at /usr/share/odeviced/plugins/<foo>.plugin



1.) Ensure that the shared module exports the init symbol of the form
    <your_plugin_name>_init(ODevicedPlugin *plugin).

    For example, for the "wifi" plugin it would be
    wifi_init(ODevicedPlugin *plugin) {.......}

    or
    
    wifi_init(ODeviced.Plugin plugin) {.......} if you are using vala



2.) If the plugin provides a DBus interface, odeviced_helpers_register_dbus_object()
    can be used to register the dbus object that pertains to the plugin interface.

    In the plugin configuration file, define the path as follows
    
    [wifi]
    dbus_object_path=/org/freesmartphone/Device/Plugins/Wifi 
    
    In case the plugin uses sysfs, compute_objects() can be used to return a list of objects, 
    one for each node under the device class. To do so define the device class as follows,
    [power]
    ...
    device_class = power_supply

    This is used in the power and the backlight plugin to register DBus paths automatically 
    based on the device class which is set in their respective configuration files.



3.) If a plugin is to be loaded at odeviced startup, append the plugin name to
    "enable" of [odeviced] group in the global configuration file. For example

    [odeviced]
    enable = powercontrol,wifi



4.) Dependencies for the plugins can be set in the plugin configuration file
    using the "depends" key.

    [battery]
    depends = powercontrol

    Multiple dependencies can be separated using ','.
