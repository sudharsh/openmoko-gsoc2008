For writing plugins refer the example ones present in plugins/

1.) Ensure that the shared module exports the init symbol of the form
<your_plugin_name>_init(ODevicedPlugin *plugin).
    For example, for the "wifi" plugin it would be
    wifi_init(ODevicedPlugin *plugin) {.......}

2.) If the plugin provides a DBus interface, the connection instance could
    be taken from, plugin->conn. It is suggested to keep the object path
    at /org/freesmartphone/Device/plugins/<your_plugin>. 

3.) If plugin is to be loaded at odeviced startup, append "enable = 1" in
    the configuration file at /etc/odeviced.conf. For example

    [wifi]
    enable = 1

4.) Dependencies for the plugins can be set in the configuration file
    using the "depends" key.

    [battery]
    enable = 0
    depends = powercontrol

    Multiple dependencies can be separated using ',' or ':'

5.) Filenames for the plugins should have "lib" prepended and should reside
    in /usr/share/odeviced/plugins

WARNING: Docs may change drastically as the code evolves :D
